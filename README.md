# Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction Experiment

# Project Overview
This project explores the performance of various unsupervised learning algorithms combined with different dimensionality reduction techniques. The goal is to evaluate which combination yields the best clustering results on a high-dimensional dataset. The project leverages the SuperUnsupervisedExperimentator class to systematically test different combinations, record their performance, and visualize the results.

# Objectives
Test different combinations of dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning algorithms: track execution time and performance metrics (e.g., Silhouette score) for each combination. Visualize results in 3D scatter plots for easy comparison.

# Dataset
For this project, a simulated dataset is generated using make_blobs from the scikit-learn library. The dataset consists of 10,000 samples with 50 features. This synthetic dataset is ideal for testing the clustering performance of various algorithms in a controlled environment.
